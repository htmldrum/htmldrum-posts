-- Statement of identity with the problem
I'm not particularly interested in start ups or the latest jQuery plugin. Never
have been. I see the success of computing in the present age as a fluke. Owing
its success to new academic theories of computation, that we still have not had time to
properly digest into the rest of society or that we have the context to properly
appreciate ourselves. It's a beautiful thing. A beauty that each user feels when
they discover a application that 'fits' for the first time. 

-- Origins of me
  My first memories of computation are those of the 2nd Wave. In the first wave,
the masters set boundaries, lose motivation and cloud their original intention
with divergent implementations. The 2nd Wave seeks to unify the first wave by
refining the ideas that survive and updating the context.
  Memory is unimportant but illustrating. The earliest memories I have of my
  exposure to consumerized computing devices was indirect. Prior to moving to
  regional Australia, I think my mother performed administration in Lend Lease
  for the Sydney 2000 Olympic project. Wandering around the offices, with my
    brother at the age of 5, I noticed that everyone had a computer that kept
    them at their desk. An overlord. An observation deck. A Damoclese sword to
    remind you that if you're not emailing your corporate, sexual oppressor with
    your whereabouts, you're forced into abject poverty in a clock cycle. 
I'm upset with the popularity of the glorification of computing in the 90's.

Perhaps some layover from the abject intellectual poverty of the 80's, most
media is concerned with nostalgia over legacy gaming systems which is itself
solely a story of corporate warfare. MASTER SYSTEM v SNES v MEGA DRIVE v
PlayStation v 64  with some
sprinkling of Shigeru Miyamoto thrown in for humanity. Raised in a single-parent household 
in one of the poorest communities in Australia, this consumerism is not mine.

Whilst I'd prefer to keep my rememberances to myself, my first real interaction
with a computer was at Kororo Public School in 1998. I'd just got a Hotmail
account and fuck I loved computers. When I went to school, I had free access to
a machine that would let me communicate with people in different worlds, didn't
require any money to keep operating. We could create and inspire and drive (ETC>
BAD )

It was here that I started building myself.
First web page. Pokemon Red v Blue. It was mine. And I don't have it anymore
because of oppressive corporate computing who didn't see it as important.

-- Origin of computing
Small teams of scientific alchemists, leveraging the resources of governments hungry
for new weapons, corporations eager for new revenue and owners of capital
  seeking more relevance in the people they exploit. These teams came together,
  whether out of necessity, greed or ennuit, and leveraged new tools we had for 

  The FreeBSD3.2 is as much art as Matisse is.

  THIS IS AMAZING OKAY?! DEAL THE FUCK WITH IT. DON'T TELL ME MARIA ABRAMOVIC
  CONTRIBUTED MORE TO SOCIETY THAN DENNIS RITCHIE.  

  FSF is the only software that doesn't try and trick you as to its complexity. 
  Proprietary software stands against humanity.
  Only difference is that proprietary software is something you can't read: Give
  example, compare binary and script languages, whom are explicit about their
  intention.

  We all seek for inclusion, input and understanding.
  Prop software limits the free expresion of people.
  Proprietary API's seek are the new proprietary software.
